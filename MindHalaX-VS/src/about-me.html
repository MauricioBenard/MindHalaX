            <h2>I am a doer, who smiles to his mistakes, in order to achieve the next stop at the top.</h2>

            <p><strong>I am  a customer experience devote, which started about 15 years ago.</strong></p>

            <p>I put on test the cutomer inter-relation on multiple ambiance. Such like
                <b>Scuba Diving</b>, being under water about 114 feet feet and trying that my customers being confortable and relax. Also worked for a while providing network remote support to users in very remote areas, where Netflix is the life motivator.
            </p>
            <p>Through the years, I constantly thought how easier my life could be if I had someone who advised me which rocks I had to avoid, shortening the way for arriving to the dream path.
            </p>

            <h3>Beginnings of my coding path</h3>

            <p>After another of my multiple adventures, I cameback from the french army and got a job as a Head Trainer for one OrangeTheory studio. Things did not worked as I planned to, reason why I was unemployed and not so happy for a couple of months,
                until I noticed that fitness industry won't give me an interesting income, reason why I moved my self, until getting an entry tech support job.</p>

            <p> After different tech companies on the process, the <strong>Corona Virus </strong>said <strong>Hello World</strong>, causing that the company in which I was at that moment, moved us to work remotely. I decided to put all my energy on learning
                coding, while being enclaustered at home</p>

            <h3>In the Coding MindHalaX</h3>
            <p>Now I am in the process of formating my mindhala, cutting with an axe all the insecurities in order to dominate some coding lagunuages.</p>

            <p> I concluded some certifications in <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> and going for much more</p>
